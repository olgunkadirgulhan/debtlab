        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>
          Most people in debt are not short on motivation; they are short on a clear picture. How long will this take? What is it costing
          me? Does an extra $100 a month matter? Our calculators answer those questions in seconds, using the same monthly interest math
          lenders use.
        </p>
        <h2>How we work</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Private by design.</strong> Calculators run in your browser. We never see your numbers.</li>
          <li><strong>Real numbers.</strong> Every figure in our articles and videos comes from an actual calculation, not a guess.</li>
          <li><strong>No hype.</strong> We avoid promises and guarantees. Your results depend on your situation.</li>
          <li><strong>Free.</strong> The site is supported by ads and clearly labeled affiliate links.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Where to find us</h2>
